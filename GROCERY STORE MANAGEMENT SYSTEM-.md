#### GROCERY STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:-





###### What This Project Does



This project is a simple console-based billing system for a grocery store. It allows you to:



Load the list of grocery items (item names and prices) from a text file.



Display all available items in the store.



Take a customer’s order, including item name and quantity.



Calculate and generate a final bill, showing item-wise subtotals and the total amount to be paid.







###### How the System Work



The program is organized into three main modules and uses two major data structures for smooth execution:



1\. Item Dictionary (Available Items)



A Python dictionary that stores all items available in the store.



Key: Item name (string)



Value: Item price (float)





This acts as the store’s inventory, loaded from an external text file.





###### 

###### 2\. Shopping Dictionary (Customer Cart)



Another dictionary that tracks the customer’s selected items.

Each entry stores:



Quantity ordered



Subtotal (price × quantity)





This is similar to a real-life shopping cart, keeping track of all items selected during shopping.







###### Technologies Used:



* Python 3



* Dictionaries for data management



* Functions for modular programming



* Loops \& Conditional statements



* File Handling for loading inventory data







###### Why This Project Is Useful:



Ideal for beginners learning how to build practical, function-based Python programs.



Demonstrates how real billing systems work using inventory and price data.



Helps students create mini-projects similar to library, cafe, or shop management systems.



Shows the importance of modular design and user interaction in console-based applications.
